# Unexpected Behavior with Instance Variables and Accessor Methods
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Ruby related to unexpected behavior when accessing instance variables within a class that has both getter and setter methods defined. The bug occurs under specific circumstances, making it difficult to identify.

## Bug Description
The provided Ruby code defines a simple class `MyClass` with an instance variable `@value`, along with getter and setter methods (`value` and `value=`).  While the code appears to correctly set and retrieve the value, under certain circumstances it may exhibit unexpected behavior. The bug is subtle and might be difficult to diagnose without careful examination.

## Solution
The solution typically involves a deeper understanding of how instance variables and accessor methods work in Ruby.  The solution may involve changes to the code or adopting best practices for using instance variables. The solution code provides a corrected implementation to prevent unexpected behavior.

## How to reproduce the bug
Clone this repository and run the `bug.rb` script. Observe that the output does not always conform to expectations under various circumstances. Analyzing the `bug.rb` and `bugSolution.rb` files will illustrate the problem and its solution.
